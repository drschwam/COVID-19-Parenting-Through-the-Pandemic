# RAND Commentary – COVID-19 Parenting Through the Pandemic 
ED & Labor Unit

#### -- Project Status: Completed.

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to identify the population of families that will likely be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Families will be impacted by COVID-19 as a result of social distancing measures (e.g., closing non-essential businesses and school/childcare options) to prevent the spread of the virus.

### Methods Used
* Descriptive statistics

### Technologies
* Stata 15

## Project Description
Using the January 2020 Basic Monthly Sample of the Current Population Survey (CPS), we identify the number of households with children under the age of 14, households with in-home childcare options (e.g., a child over the age of 14 and under the age of 18 that does not work and can look after the younger children), and households with multiple incomes, among other characteristics. Doing so will allow us to understand the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will affect U.S. families and begin to understand the national cost of combating the spread of the disease.
